This is the decompiled (using [Vineflower](https://github.com/Vineflower/vineflower)) source code for my Minecraft mod, "Regablith's MoreTools". This was one of the first things I programmed at the ripe old age of 12. [The last release was published on March 29, 2012 for Minecraft 1.2.4.](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/regabliths-moretools)

If you want, you can [download the mod here on GitHub](https://github.com/seaneoo/MoreTools/releases/tag/1.2.4_MoreTools_V.5). It requires [Risugami's ModLoader](https://mcarchive.net/mods/modloader).
